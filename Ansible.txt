Ansible:

It is used for Configuration Mangement,(is a software engineering discipline consisting of standard processes and techniques often used by organizations to manage the changes introduced to its software products or code)
               
               Application Deployment

               Service Orchestration

How Ansible Works:

Relation ship between main pieces of Ansible:

---->Admin client establishes connection with Ansible via ssh,

---->Later, Ansible server gather facts from client like, OS and services running on it. Then, it starts running playbook on the client.
      
     (Play book can be used to assign roles, run tasks(deleting files), use modules, substitute variables)


---->Playbooks:

--->They define your deployment steps and configuration

--->They are modular, can contain variables and can be used to orchestrate steps across multiple machines.

--->ansible PlayBook are config files written in YAML(Yet ANother MarkUp Language)

--->Those are going to invoke Ansible modules in things called tasks


---->Sample Playbook that sets up a webserver:

----
hosts:webservers

vars:

  http_port = 80
  remote_user = root

tasks:
 -name: update apache
  yum: pkg=httpd state=latest

 -name: configure apache
  template: src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf

  notify:
  
  - restart apache
  -name: always run apache
   service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
