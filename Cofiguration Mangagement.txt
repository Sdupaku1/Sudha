----->Def: 

Configuration management as the name itself explains, is nothing but managing all the configurations of the environments that the software application hosts upon.

we have different environments throughout the SDLC in DevOps starting with Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing and end-user testing.

The environment set up’s for these tests would progressively become more complex as it moves towards pre-production and production environment.

Basically, configuration management is the automated process to manage all the configurations of each of these environments.

------> In DevOps, typically, all these configuration management processes are pretty well automated and the configurations are encapsulated in the form of code or scripts and controlled through the version control tool.




In our context: Maintaining consistency of our software configuration.Tools that help us in achieving this is Ansible, saltstack, puppet, Chef.
