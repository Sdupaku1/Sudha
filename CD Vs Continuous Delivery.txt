Continuous Delivery does not involve deployment to production on every change that occurs. You just need to ensure that the code is always in a deployable state, so you can deploy it easily whenever you want.

On the other hand, Continuous Deployment requires every change to be deployed automatically, without human intervention.

So, as you can see in the diagram once Continuous Integration stages are completed, the newly built application is automatically deployed to production then it is Continuous Deployment. 

On the other hand, if we manage to automate everything, but decide to require a human approval in order to proceed with the deployment of the new version, then we are taking into account Continuous Delivery.  

Well, the difference is very much subtle, but it has enormous implications, making each technique appropriate for various situations.


Continuous Deployment:(with out human intervention)

Deploying the built application onto production servers for release in an automated fashion.
